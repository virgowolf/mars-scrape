# mars-scrape
This code scrapes and analyzes Mars weather data using Beautifulsoup. 
Part 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.
Part 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data from an html table using pandas.
I received assistance from Xpert Learning Assistant, an Ai tool provided through the UC Berkeley Data Analytics Bootcamp program.
Code and output are both viewable in the folder titled "Code_and_Output".
